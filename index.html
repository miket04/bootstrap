            The Why of CDs:  
        </h1> 
        <h2 class="subtext">First, a brief history:</h2>

        <h3 class="info">CDs, full name the "Compact Disk", were invented in 1979 as a prototype by American physicist James Russell. Finalized in 1980, Phillips and Sony coordinated to produce CDs. The resulting design was a thin disk that could hold up to 80 minutes of music, compatable with CD players only. <br><br>
    
        In 1982, CDs were made public and took the world by storm. These disks quickly became the most efficient way of playing and storing music, replacing vinyl and cassette tapes. Unique features included:
        </h3>
        <ul class="features">
            <li>Could hold up to 80 minutes of songs, with a capacity of 700mb.</li>
            <li>Cheap and avaiability high in public markets</li>
            <li>Capable of storing multiple medias and information, such as games, videos, or software.</li>
        </ul>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h3 class="info">
            Understandably, this made the CD quite popular and replaced the former methods of storage. In 1988, US CD sales overtook vinyl. In 1992, CDs passed casssete tapes. At their peak, they sold 67 million copies annually in the US. This information is crucial to understanding the shift that CDs would produce-and eventually give way-for.

        <h1 class="Introduction">Competition</h1>
            <h2 class="subtext">As all things do, Disks hit their peak and fall.</h2>
            <p class="info2">When we talk about competition, it's an easy answer. It's technology itself. The era of CDs was fairly shortlived, lasting only about two decades. The device that stopped this tremendous goliath was Apple's 2001 release: The iPod. The iPod was, like the CD itself, an ingenious invention for its time. A sleek and portable box that carried music had every advantage over disks for consumers. Only 7 years after the iPod's release, CD singles begin to be dropped by retailers and manufacturers due to decreasing demand. From there, downward slope gets worse. 2010: US sales decline to 50% of original peak, 2012: US sales of SACDs dip below 100,000 copies. By 2014, digital music revenues equalled the combined total of physical format sales.  </p>
